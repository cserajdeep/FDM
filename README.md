Traditional Discernibility Matrix-based feature selection (works on descretized dataset):
1. my_discrn_mat.py (it deals with only 26 features)
2. my_discrn_mat52.py (it deals with 52 features)

The new Fuzzy Discernibility Matrix-based can also work with continuous value dataset:
my_fuzzy_discrn_mat.py (for any number of features)
e.g., Irish_Evaluation_notebook.ipynb demonstrates both the feature selection techniques on standard Iris dataset.
